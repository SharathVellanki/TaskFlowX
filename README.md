## Introduction
TaskFlowX is a distributed workflow automation platform enabling the creation, chaining, and execution of tasks in real time. It supports both local and cloud execution, with built-in observability and a streaming dashboard for logs and metrics.

---

## Background
Modern automation requires low latency, scalability, and transparency. TaskFlowX uses Redis Pub/Sub, AWS services, and an Angular-based dashboard to achieve sub-150ms latency while processing thousands of events per minute.

---

## Objective
The primary goal is to deliver a reliable, event-driven automation system that integrates with cloud services, supports real-time monitoring, and scales for high-throughput workflows.

---

## Approach
- Event-driven execution using Redis Pub/Sub  
- AWS integrations: DynamoDB for state storage, Lambda for execution, SQS for durable queueing  
- Angular dashboard for real-time workflow visualization and alerts  
- JWT-secured FastAPI backend  

---

## Significance
TaskFlowX powers high-throughput pipelines, enabling real-time decision-making and reducing operational delays through instant visibility into task and workflow states.

---

## Features
- Task & workflow management with status tracking  
- Event-driven execution with Redis Pub/Sub  
- AWS-based persistence and serverless task execution  
- Real-time dashboard for logs, metrics, and alerts  
- Observability with Prometheus and Grafana
